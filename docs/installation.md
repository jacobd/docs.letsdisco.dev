# Installation

## macOS

Assuming you already have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, run:

```bash
brew install letsdiscodev/tap/disco-cli
```

To update to the latest version, run:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade disco-cli
```


## All other operating systems

The disco command line tool is currently only packaged for macOS.

If you're comfortable installing Python packages, you can install the command line tool from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/letsdiscodev/disco-cli).

We hope to provide more package options in the future.
