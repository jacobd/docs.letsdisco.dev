# Introduction

**Disco lets you easily deploy web backend projects to your own servers**

You will need:
1. **A server** you can ssh into. We recommend getting a virtual server from **[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/)** or **[Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)**
2. **A domain name**. You can register one with **[Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/)**, **[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)**, or **[easydns.com](https://easydns.com/)**
3. The `disco` **command line tool** installed on your computer
4. A project to deploy! It can be a static site or a backend project made with Python, Flask, Django, Node, Rails, Go, etc.

**[Start by installing the disco CLI on your development machine](/get-started/install-the-cli)** â†’
