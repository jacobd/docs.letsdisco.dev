# Introduction

**disco lets you easily deploy and manage web projects onto your own servers**

You will need:
1. A server you can ssh into. We recommend a virtual server from [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) or [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). Or a Raspberry Pi!
2. A domain name. You can register one with [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/), [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), or [easydns.com](https://easydns.com/)
3. A web project to deploy. It can be a static site or a backend project made with Python, Flask, Django, Node, Rails, Go, etc.
4. The `disco` command line tool installed on your computer

[Let's start by installing the disco CLI on your development machine](/get-started/install-the-cli) â†’
